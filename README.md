I decided to start my Machine Learning journey with the Handwritten Digit Recognition Project. I developed the model on this Kaggle dataset first, and then trained the model using the MNIST dataset using Google Colab. I then converted the trained model to a */TensorflowJS*/ (tfjs) file and loaded it onto my website using */tf.loadLayersModel.*/

I thought that just training a model was too generic and common. I wanted to make something that was more interactive and fun for the user. So I decided to add a canvas on which the user can write their number on it, and it would be converted into a 28x28 image that can be interpreted by the train model to produce an output. I also wanted to show visually the predictions of the model to engage the user more.
